Anope Proxy Detector
--------------------

1) Introduction
2) Alternatives

1) Introduction

    Anope has had a built-in proxy detector since it's first version. Recently,
    however, this built-in proxy detector has been removed. This was because
    the Anope team found that the proxy detector was showing it's age, and the
    time needed to restore it to a good state wasn't worth it, also considering
    that there are currently good alternatives out there which do the job as
    good as it can be done already.

2) Alternatives

    A) Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor (BOPM)
    B) NeoStats + OPSB

    Note that these are seperate projects and that the Anope team won't give
    support on these programs. For support, please refer to the sites of the
    creators of the software packages.

    A) Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor (BOPM)

        URL: http://wiki.blitzed.org/BOPM

        BOPM is currently the leading proxy detector for IRC networks out
        there. Altough it is not designed to run on a central place for the
        entire network, it can be done with some minor tweaking on most IRCd's.
        The Anope Team advises BOPM for the best security.

    B) NeoStats + OPSB

        URL: http://www.neostats.net/

        NeoStats is the swiss knife of IRC tools. In combination with the OPSB
        module by NeoStats Software, it can scan for proxies in a similar way
        as BOPM does. The OPSB module is based on BOPM and has been adjusted to
        be able to scan all clients from one centralized proxy detector.
