1) Installing Anope

    IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not recommended to use (and therefore install)
                    Anope as root. Use an unprivileged user instead -- the
                    one you're using for the ircd or a dedicated one will
                    be good enough.

    The very first thing you need to do is to get the Anope package (if not
    already done). You can find it at:

        http://www.anope.org/

    Next, unpack the package in your home directory, and go into the created
    directory.

    Now type ./Config to start the configuration script. It will ask you a
    few questions, and figure out how to compile Anope on your system. If
    you are unsure about the answer to a question, use the default value. 

    NOTE: although you may specify different binary and data paths, it is
          RECOMMENDED that you use the same value for both.

    You can now type make to compile Anope. If there are errors in the
    Makefile, *try to use gmake* instead. If it still doesn't work, you (or
    the system administrator if it's a shell) must install GNU make. You may
    find it at ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/.

    Now type make install (or gmake install; see above). This will install
    all the needed files in the paths you specified with the configure
    script, and setup file permissions. You should ensure that the data
    directory is not accessible by other users, as malicious users may
    cause trouble on your network if passwords are not encrypted, or read
    the memos of any user.

    If you see errors during this process, please mail us with the *complete*
    error output, and don't forget to mention your OS, compiler and C library
    versions. 

    Now go into the data directory (by default, ~/services). Copy the example
    configuration file (example.conf) to services.conf, and open the latter
    with your favorite text editor. It contains all the configuration
    directives Anope will use at startup. Read the instructions contained in
    the file carefully. Using the default values is NOT a good idea, and will
    most likely not work!

    If you need help, you should subscribe to the Anope mailing list and mail
    there to get help from other users. See the README file for more
    information.

2) Upgrading Anope

    If you got a .diff file and want to patch the old Anope sources with it,
    do the following:

        * Copy the .diff file into the root Anope sources directory.
        * Type patch -p1 <file.diff

    Note that upgrading anope with a patchfile isn't recommended. You should
    download a new, clean source package, as this will give the best results.

    To upgrade Anope, just follow the installation instructions described in
    section 1. There are however a few specific guidelines:

        * IMPORTANT: Back up your old databases!
        * If you are upgrading to a new major release, ALWAYS restart a
          fresh configuration file from example.conf.

3) Setting up the IRCd

    Services acts as an IRC server with pseudo-clients on it. To link them to
    your network, you'll need to add some lines in the ircd.conf of their hub
    server (as stated in the RemoteServer configuration directive).

    For samples below we'll take services.localhost.net as the name of the
    Services (as stated in the ServerName configuration directive). Note that
    this samples are made to be as generic as possible, but there might be
    small variations, depending on your IRCd. For IRCd-specific help with
    configuration, read near the end of this section.

    First, the C/N lines, that allow Services to link. They also need a
    Y:line to work correctly.

        Y:27:180:0:0:4000000
        C:127.0.0.1:mypass:services.localhost.net::30
        N:127.0.0.1:mypass:services.localhost.net::30

    "mypass" is the same password you mentioned in the RemoteServer
    configuration directive. 127.0.0.1 is the IP from which Services connect
    from (linking in localhost is the most efficient way to run Services).

    Then, you have to set-up an U:line, that will allow Services to change
    channel modes, topics, and much more without being opped in the channel.

        U:services.localhost.net:*:*

    NOTE: if you have more than one server in your network, this line MUST
          be added on ALL servers, or things won't work correctly.

    Finally, you'll need to add an H:line, to make the OperServ JUPE command
    work correctly.

        H:*::Services.LocalHost.Net

    Don't forget to /rehash your IRCd to apply changes.

    A new trend in ircd configuration is popping all over the place, good
    examples are the latest Hybrid, Unreal and Bahamut, which use a more
    "readable" form of configuration. For those, use something like:

        link services.localhost.net
        {
            username        *;
            hostname        localhost;
            bind-ip         *;
            port            6667;
            hub             *;
            password-connect "mypass";
            password-receive "mypass";
            class           servers;
        };

    Note that this block-style configuration files differ heavily, depending
    on the IRCd. Consult the interactive link maker (link is below) for more
    details on the exact configuration used by your IRCd.

    If you're unable to get a link with your IRCd after reading this section,
    you might try the interactive link maker, which is located at:

        http://anope.org/~heinz/ilm.php

4) Starting Anope

    Go into the directory where binaries were installed (by default, this is
    ~/services). Type ./services to launch Anope.

    If there are syntax errors in the configuration file they will be
    displayed on the screen. Correct them until there are no errors anymore.
    A successful startup won't generate any message. 

    Give Services at least one minute to link to your network, as certain
    IRCds on some OSes may be really slow for the link process. If nothing
    happens after about a minute, it is probably a configuration problem. Try
    to launch Anope with ./services -debug -nofork to see any errors that it
    encounters, and try to correct them.

    If you need help to solve errors, feel free to subscribe to the Anope
    mailing list and ask there. See the README file for details.

5) Setting up a crontab

    A crontab entry will allow you to check periodically whether Anope is
    still running, and restart it if not. You'll need to have Anope binaries
    and data installed in the same directory for this to work without
    modification.

    First rename the example.chk script that is in Anope path (by default,
    this is ~/services) to services.chk and edit it. You'll need to modify
    the CONFIGURATION part of the file. Then ensure that the file is marked
    as executable by typing chmod +x services.chk, and try to launch the
    script to see if it works (Anope must not be running when you do this ;))

    When this is done, you'll have to add the crontab entry. Type crontab -e.
    This will open the default text editor with the crontab file. Enter the
    following (with correct path):

        */5 * * * * /home/ircd/services/services.chk >/dev/null 2>&1

    The */5 at the beginning means "check every 5 minutes". You may replace
    the 5 with other another number if you want (but less than 60). Consult
    your system's manual pages for more details on the syntax of the crontab
    file. Interesting manpages are crontab(5), crontab(1) and cron(8).

    Save and exit, and it's installed.
