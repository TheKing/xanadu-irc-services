1) Anope SMTP Client

    Provided with Anope is a simple SMTP client which can be used instead of
    programs like SendMail in some cases.

    The SMTP client can be used instead of sendmail for use with Anope's mail
    options. To use the SMTP client instead of sendmail, find the line in your
    services configuration file (services.conf) that defines SendMailPath. On
    that line, change the path to your services installation directory, then
    followed by "tools/anopesmtp" and the IP address of a valid SMTP server. It
    should look like this:

        SendMailPath "/home/anope/services/tools/anopesmtp 127.0.0.1"

    If the SMTP client doesn't send mail, or if there's an other problem with
    it, you can compile it in debug mode. To do this, open smtp.h, and look
    for "smtp_debug" near the bottom. Change this from 0 to 1 and recompile
    the code. This should generate a log file of what happened when it tried
    to connect to the SMTP server.

2) Anope Database Merger

    This program tries to merge two standard Anope database sets (ChanServ,
    NickServ, BotServ, and MemoServ).

    To merge two database sets, put them both in the folder where the merger
    is located. The first database set must be named <name>1.db (nick1.db,
    chan1.db, etc); the second database set must be named <name>2.db (nick2.db,
    chan2.db, etc). If you execute the merger now the databases will be merged
    into databases named <name>.db.

3) Epona to Anope Database Converter

    This program tries to convert databases made by epona .4.15 and up to
    standard anope databases. Currently, only the ChanServ database needs to
    be converted.

    Put your Epona (ChanServ) database in the folder where the epona2anope
    executable file is located. Rename this ChanServ database file to
    chan1.db and then run the converter (epona2anope). A new database called
    chan.db will be created; this file is Anope-compatible.
