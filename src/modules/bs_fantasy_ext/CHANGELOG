       Corrected some errors in the description of several configuration directives.
       Added missing second layer services oper check for !akill
       !down no longer removes voice if channel is moderated and user has more then just voice...
       !mute now allows superadmins to mute the channel founder (reported by EvilSeph)
           (No bug in bs_fantasy_ext so works only when used with Anope-1.7.20+. CF Anope bug #770)

       Added !suspend command.
