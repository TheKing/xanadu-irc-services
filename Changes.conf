###########################################################################

# EncModule <module_name>  [REQUIRED]
#     The encryption module to use when dealing with passwords.
#     This determines how the passwords are stored in the databases,
#     and does not add any security as far as transmitting passwords over
#     the network goes.
#     enc_none provides no password encryption, storing the password in
#     plain text, this is the most versiatle as passwords can easily be
#     recovered.
#
#     NOTE: users of anope's previous (broken) md5 implementation should 
#     select the enc_old option, or things may break.
#
#     NOTE2: Some of these encryption methods are one-way (md5, sha1, old)
#     meaning that you can NOT retrive the passwords in plain text once
#     encrypted.
#
#     Plain Text                -  enc_none
#     Previous (broken) MD5     -  enc_old

###########################################################################

# Note: if ProxyDetect is not set, all parameters after it in this section
# are optional.

# ProxyDetect [OPTIONAL]
#
# Enables insecure proxy detection. Services will automatically
# scan each incoming user and akill those that use insecure proxy.
#
# Anope currently supports detection of Wingate (port 23), SOCKS4/5
# (port 1080), and HTTP proxy (ports 3128 and 8080). It uses the
# protocol of each proxy type to connect to an IRC server, it does
# not only check if the port is open (so your users may still have
# an open telnet server on their port 23 for example).
#
# WARNING: You should get the authorization of the administrator of
# the computer which runs the proxy detector before enabling it; not
# all administrators will accept it. Also note that in certain
# countries, port scanning is prohibited.
#
# This feature requires threading support to be compiled into Anope.

#ProxyDetect

# ProxyThreads <number> [REQUIRED]
#
# Sets the number of threads Services will launch when starting. Each
# thread will have the responsibility to scan queued hostname for
# proxies.
#
# This value must be set depending of the number of users you have
# on your network. The more threads are used, the more simultaneous
# checks can be done. Remember however, that threads are
# resource-consuming.
#
# WARNING: On Linux, each thread takes a background process, and there
# is an additional process used for thread management; this is a problem
# if you are limited in the number of background process you can use
# (on a paid shell for example).

ProxyThreads 5

# ProxyMessage... <message> [RECOMMENDED]
#
# Sets the notices that will be sent out to users before Services
# scan them for proxy. You may not use all of them, but just as much as
# necessary.

ProxyMessage1 "I will now detect if you're using an insecure proxy."
ProxyMessage2 "If you see a connection on port 23, 1080, 3128 or 8080 from"

#ProxyMessage5 "Enter"
#ProxyMessage6 "whatever"

# ProxyCheck... [OPTIONAL]
#
# Determines what types of proxy Anope will try to find (respectively

#
# Sets the length of time before a normal host cache entry expires, if

# Every non-proxy hosts will be stored in cache (to avoid too many scans
# to the same host), so you should set this enough low to not fill your
